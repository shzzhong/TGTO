The code used in the paper "Topology optimization with text-guided stylization" has now been uploaded.
The code should work well in various environment setups. 
As for the CLIP installation, please follow: https://github.com/openai/CLIP

Currently, minor bugs may exist, thus the code will be updated soon.
Known issue: Only square optimization space (i.e., resolution a*a) can be handled, for simple coding.
